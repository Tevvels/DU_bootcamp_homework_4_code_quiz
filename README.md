The Rules goes as fellows

    player started the quiz.
    a timer starts counting down from one minute (60s)
    the player will be give 5 questions that they will have to answer.
        correct answer will continue through the quiz as normal
        the incorrect  answer will cause a 15 second deduction on the timer.
    your score is the remaining value left from your timer which displays at the end of the game.


    In this project I = dymanically created elements for the buttons and end screen. and applied an eventlistener to
    listen for the users input. Once that occured the callback function will compare the textContent of the element to the correct answer
    for any give question. on either response the a counter is applied and new question is displayed.
